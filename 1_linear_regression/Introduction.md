## Linear Regression with Single Variable ##

Linear regression shows the linear relationship between the independent(predictor) variable i.e. X-axis and the dependent(output) variable i.e. Y-axis, called linear regression. If there is a single input variable X(independent variable), such linear regression is called simple linear regression.
